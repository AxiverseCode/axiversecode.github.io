# Contributing

This engine is designed to be a game and simulation engine. Its specifications are to be able to
simulate complex environments with a sizable number of interactive entities, some controlled by
players and some controlled by AI processes. For contributions to be successful, we want to ensure
that contributing is both meaningful for the individuals devoting their personal time and it is
productive towards helping the project reach its goal.
